Have the function `stock_picker(arr)` take the array of numbers stored in `arr`, which will contain integers that represent the amount in dollars that a single stock is worth, and return the maximum profit that could have been made by buying stock on day **x** and selling stock on day **y**, where **y** > **x**.

For example: if `arr` is [44, 30, 24, 32, 35, 30, 40 38, 15], then the program should return **16** because at index 2 the stock was worth 24 and at index 6 the stock was then worth 40. So, stock bought at 24 and sold at 40 would have made a profit of 16, which is the maximum profit that could have been made with this list of stock prices.
