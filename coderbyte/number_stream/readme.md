Create a function `number_stream(str)` that takes the `str` parameter being passed, which contains the numbers 2 through 9, and determine if there is a consecutive stream of digits of at least `N` length where `N` is the actual digit value.

If so, the program should return **true**; otherwise, the program should return **false**. For example: if `str` is "6539923335", then the program should return **true** because there is a consecutive stream of 3's of length 3.
